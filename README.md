(Note added in 2024)
Please note: When adding/replacing entries to an IMG file using IMG Factory, this edits your input IMG/DIR files, always take a backup of your IMG/DIR before using features in this tool.
The tool does this because the new sub-files need to be stored somewhere before rebuilding.
An alternative solution would have been to store the newly added sub-files into a temporary directory, however the source code was lost and IMG Factory will likely never be changed to support this.
